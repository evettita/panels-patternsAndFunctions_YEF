# panels-patternsAndFunctions_YEF
Created 7/26/2017

 This Repo will hold the Pattern files and position_function files required to play Yvette's visual stimuli on her panel Arena system for 
 her Ephy rig. 

 This repo way made to seperate the pattern specific code (ie patterns, position funcitons, and matlab scripts to create these functions) from the Wilson Lab's Forked version of the Reiser Panel Matlab Code and C code (firmware). Which will now be maintained within the Wilson Lab git account. 


TODO:
 -delete extra files that are not currently in use. 
 -clean up Pattern creation and position function creation code!
